XPLR Space is a basic python project which allows users to display, search and acquire knowledge about our universe and its elements such as planets, constellations, galaxies, stars and the astronauts who have successfully visited it.
By default, it uses the universal data from the MySQL database which contains all specific information that can also be later edited and more records can be added. 
The program contains two working opinions, one as Admin and the other as User. 
The admin has the right to add and delete information in the database. 
While, the user has the option to view the data, search the data and get an analytical view through the graphs.
